# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Buisness Managment Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My website will help keep track of business sales and income.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'll be building a website that will help a business keep track of their sales and income. I plan to implement a user module so the user can log 
into the website and have information displayed specifically for them. I also intend, if I can finish with time to spare, to add a 'stock' section so the user can keep track of 
their business stock. I'll be able to do this by using Flask and databases. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be that I'll be able to get the website up and running. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be that I'll be able to take user input in order to record their sales and income. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be that I'll have implemented the user module and the 'stock' section. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

New skills that I will need to acquire would be learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Those are the fundamentals to building a website so they're a must-know. Using the CS50x web programming guide online, I'll hopefully be able to acquire all the skills I need to finish my project before the deadline. I'll also do outside research on web programming to
see if I can add other unique things to my website.
